Test Program: ProjectData

How to Run:
1. Use Visual Studio 2017 to open ProjectData.sln
2. Start Debugging (click F5) to start the program by IISExpress
3. There are 5 major pages: Projects list, Project detail to edit members, Add new Project, Contacts list, Add new Contact.

Key features: 
1. ProjectData.sln is a project of Visual Studio 2017
2. Database file: ProjectDatabase.mdf under "App_Data" folder
   It contains two tables: Project and Contact
3. Angular.js is version 1.5.2. All codes are under "App" folder
4. The code uses CSS framework BootStrap.
5. Some simple Unit Tests (using NUnit) are added into testing ProjectData.Tests
6. Dependency Injection has not been added into Angular. I will add it in the later version or discuss it in the interview.
